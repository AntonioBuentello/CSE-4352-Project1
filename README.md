# Network Protocol Stack Implementation

This is a repository containing the source code for a network protocol stack implementation in C. The protocol stack includes functions for subscribing, publishing, disconnecting, and connecting, as well as code for sending SYN and ACK messages. This implementation is designed to work with the TM4C123GXL microcontroller in Code Composer Studio.

## Introduction

The network protocol stack is a set of software components that implements communication protocols for networked devices. The protocol stack typically consists of layers that each provide a specific set of services to the layers above and below it. The functions implemented in this project are typically associated with the application layer of the protocol stack, which is responsible for providing application-level services such as message exchange and data transfer between networked devices. The SYN and ACK messages are typically associated with the transport layer, which is responsible for reliable and ordered delivery of data between networked devices.
